# General Disclosures
The Peer Cooperative (“TPC”) and all associated are not affiliated with or endorsed by any healthcare or otherwise regulated and/or licensed entity, facility, company, organization, institution, curriculum, or provider.

TPC programs, services, and resources are in no way, semblance, shape, form, or attempt to be a replacement for mental health care, therapy, or treatment. Please immediately dial 911 if you are experiencing distress and follow your safety plan.
Your participation is always entirely voluntary
Our infrastructure requires that you have a previous or existing client relationship with McLaren Flint’s Oak Bridge Center. If you do not, we empathize and apologize for the inconvenience.

The Peer Cooperative Guidelines apply at all times, including at in-person events and in virtual communities. Your access and membership are a privilege, not a right.

While organizers are not mandatory reporters by statute, references to suicide, homicide, or abuse of oneself or others may prompt a private conversation with an organizer and a follow-up with a community welfare official, which may include the police. We reserve and will execute our right to help you stay safe.

We are the first to recognize the emotional trauma that may be associated with this process. We will do our very best to ensure your comfort and work through coping techniques in acute situations, but we are not healthcare professionals and, therefore, cannot provide therapy or adequate care and must rely on community health resources, which may include the police.
Therapy dogs are often present at events, so please let us know about any pet allergies ahead of time. We will do our best to accommodate you.

We reserve the right to amend our expectations and guidelines at any time.
